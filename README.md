Node GraphQL API

This project is a demonstration of how GraphQL can be utilized in a Node.js application. GraphQL is a powerful query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need, making it efficient and flexible for building modern applications.

Features

GraphQL: This API leverages GraphQL to provide a flexible and efficient way to query and manipulate data.
Node.js: The server is built using Node.js, a popular runtime for server-side JavaScript applications.
Apollo Server: Apollo Server is used as a GraphQL server implementation, providing a robust and scalable foundation for your GraphQL API.
Documentation: You can explore and interact with the GraphQL schema using Apollo GraphiQL. This tool allows you to test queries and mutations against your API interactively.
